    <h2> Subjects of study </h2>
     <p> At the Awesome science univerity, we have a pretty open-minded facility, as long as the subject fall within the realm of science and technology.
         You seem like an intelligent dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person you'd like to have on your team. Saying that,of the ideas you have submitted, we feel most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority.</p>
     
     <ol>
         <li> Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine,and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
         <li> Measuring the effects on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (38<sup>o</sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effects of 3 * 10<sup>3</sup> &lt; 3 * 10 <sup> 4</sup>)</li>
         <li> <abbr title="Hypertext markup language">HTML </abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading style sheet"> CSS </abbr> constructs for repreenting musical scores.</li>
     </ol>
        <p> So please can you provide more information on each of the subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you'd think we would like to know?Thanks. </p> </article>
     
     <h2> Exotic dance moves</h2>
     <p> Yes, you are right!, as part of post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dance. To answer your question, my favourite dance as as follows: </p>
     <dl>
     <dt> Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
         <dd> A little known , but <em> very </em>influential dance, dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like a chicken, to encourage their livestocks to be "fruitful".</dd>
     <dt>   Icelandic island shuffle </dt>
         <dd> Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,they used to practice this dance,which involves huddling close together in a circle on the floor,and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably tiny,very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
     <dt> Arctic robot dance</dt>  
         <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation,english explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by"robotic",stilted movements,being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>
